# Horiseon Social Solution Servies Webpage

## Description

This project is the full source code of the Horiseon Social Solution Services webpage.
It includes the HTML structuring file plus the CSS style sheet.
The webpage was made as an informational site to give users information regarding their online social presence and how it affects them. This is done with text and accompanying images.
Making this site I learned about using semantic elements to give a clear understanding as to what each tag is doing. I also learned to consolidate my CSS stylings to group similarly styled elements together to achieve a less crowded codebase.
